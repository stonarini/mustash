### DISCLAIMER
This software proudly runs on Linux and (less proudly) Windows.
We do not officially support Apple devices.

If it appears to function on an Apple device, it's purely accidental.
Any resemblance to compatibility with macOS is coincidental, unintentional, and honestly, it kind of bothers me.
